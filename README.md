Environment Variables: Securely manage API keys using .env files with the help of python-dotenv.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python: The core programming language for fetching and processing flight data.
APIs Used:
Amadeus API: Provides detailed flight information and allows users to search for flights across multiple airlines.
Sheety API: Facilitates seamless integration with Google Sheets to store and update flight prices dynamically.
Requests Library: For handling HTTP requests to the various APIs.
dotenv: For managing environment variables and API keys.
üìà How it Works
